Data are not available for Jul 2002 at site SRS1b at plot 1, so for Sawgrass_AG_Biomass (g/m2), Sawgrass_AG_Biomass_STD, Sawgrass_Culm_Density, and Sawgrass_Culm_Density_ STD only measurements from 2 plots were used (SRS1b-2 & SRS1b-3) during the Jul 2002 sampling event.

On 2011-08-22 a wildfire burned the vegetation at SRS1d plots, measurements of new plants started on 2011-09-27; from September 2011 until January 2015 three non-burned plots were stablished and measured at the site, the non-burned data (Sawgrass_AG_Biomass, Sawgrass_AG_Biomass_STD, Sawgrass_Culm_densidy & Sawgrass_Culm_Density_STD) is reported as SRS1d non-burned sites.

In September 2017 Hurricane Irma damaged all the plots at SRS2 and SRS3, measurements of new plants started in November 2017.
